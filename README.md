# GPSPA_project
Git repository for GPSPA group project

/data is a folder which contains the most up to date General Transit Feed Specification (here forth referred to as GTFS) data. This is data that will be fed into our database live once the API is set up and configured. For now, I have made this data available so the group can explore and understand the structure of the data our program will be receiving. 

Project Architecture.png is the proposed structure of our project, both backend and frontend. Any changes and/or improvements are welcome.

Attempt 1.ipynb is where I have begun to play with the data to understand its structure and general makeup.
